# Flappy-Bird
 Welcome to my Flappy Bird clone, developed using Java Swing! This project replicates the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, where the player controls a bird and navigates it through pipes without hitting them. Itâ€™s my first project in game development and Java Swing, and I'm excited to share it with you.
