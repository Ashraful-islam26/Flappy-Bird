Flappy Bird Clone - Java Swing
Description
Welcome to my Flappy Bird clone, developed using Java Swing! This project replicates the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, where the player controls a bird and navigates it through pipes without hitting them. Itâ€™s my first project in game development and Java Swing, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with you.

Features
Basic Gameplay: Control the bird to fly through pipes by pressing the space bar.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you navigate through the pipes.
Collision Detection: Game over when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
Future Enhancements
I plan to add the following features in future updates:

Pause and Restart Button: Ability to pause the game and restart it.
Main Menu: A menu to start the game, view instructions, and exit.
High Score System: Track and display the highest score achieved by the player.
