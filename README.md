## Flappy Bird Clone - Java Swing

### Description

Welcome to my Flappy Bird clone, developed using Java Swing! This project replicates the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, where the player controls a bird and navigates it through pipes without hitting them. It’s my first project in game development and Java Swing, and I'm excited to share it with you.

### Features

- **Basic Gameplay**: Control the bird to fly through pipes by pressing the space bar.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you navigate through the pipes.
- **Collision Detection**: Game over when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

### Future Enhancements

I plan to add the following features in future updates:
- **Pause and Restart Button**: Ability to pause the game and restart it.
- **Main Menu**: A menu to start the game, view instructions, and exit.

### Acknowledgments
Inspiration

This Flappy Bird clone project draws its inspiration from the original Flappy Bird game concept by Dong Nguyen.

Additionally, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to @KennyYipCoding  for their  tutorials and guidance. Their content provided a solid foundation for understanding the basics of development, particularly with java swing, which I adapted to create this project.



Enjoy playing and happy coding! 🚀
